				<img src={subject_viewer} />

				<ol>
					<li>
						On the left panel, you will see the <b>subject image</b>
						as seen during classification, followed by the <b>associated metadata</b>. 
					</li>
				
					<li>
						Below this, there is a map 
						showing the <b>mosaic of all images from this perijove</b>, and 
						the <b>location of this subject</b>. 
					</li>

					<li>
						On the right, you will see an <b>interactive window</b> which shows a 
						small segment of this mosaic, centered on the subject. The black outline 
						shows the <b>edge of the subject on the mosaic</b> (note that this outline will be 
						very curved near the polar regions, since the physical spacing between longitude lines 
						will shrink).
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p>
				On the interactive window, the panel on the top right will show a selection of tools that can be 
				used to interact with the mosaic. You can use the zoom tool to zoom into a specific region, or the
				pan tool to move around. If you would like to share this mosaic on Talk, you can click the first
				option (camera icon) to download the image and share it with Talk 
				(note that you will need to use an image upload service, like 
				<a href="https://imgur.com/"> Imgur</a> to get a link to the image).

const exploreHelpText = () => {

		<div>
			<p>
				The exploration page contains four elements. To illustrate the different options available
				on this page, please watch this overview:
			</p>

				<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttDVrAhwHh8" 
					title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" 
					allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
					allowfullscreen></iframe>
			</p>

			<p>
				Each element is described in detail below:
				<img src={explore_data} />

				<ol>
					<li>
						On the left panel, you will see a set of options for creating plots. In this panel, 
						you can select the type of plot and the variables (latitude, latitude 
						or perijove). On plotting, you can filter the data by perijove, and whether you want 
						to show only vortices found by volunteers in the "Is there a Vortex" workflow. 
						<br/>

						There are currently two plot types to choose from:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Histogram</b>: This is good for finding the number of subjects
								that fall within specific ranges. For example, plotting a histogram
								of latitude values will show the distribution of cloud features by latitude 
								(e.g., features in the equator look different from those at the poles!). 
								On picking the histogram option, you will be asked to choose the variable
								to use for plotting.
							</li>
							
							<img src={hist} />
							
							<li>
								<b>Scatter</b>: A scatter plot is 2-dimensional plot type, and is useful for
								identifying relationships between the two variables. For example, you can plot
								longitude on the x-axis and latitude on the y-axis to show the locations of 
								features on the jovian map. On selecting this option, you will be asked to 
								choose the x- and the y-variable to plot.
							</li>
							
							<img src={scatter} />

						</ul>
					</li>
				
					<li>
						Once you have selected your plot type and variables, you can click "Plot!" to generate
						the plot. This will create an interactive window in the center of the page with 
						the requested plot. You can use the toolbar in the top right of the plot to zoom,
						pan or select the data. You can also save the plot out to an image and use it 
						for discussions in Talk. There will also be two windows below the plot that will show 
						a set of subject images, as discussed below:
					</li>

					<li>
						The left window show the set of subjects currently <span style={{color:'#2e86c1'}}>selected</span>. By default, all the 
						data will be selected, so you will see the full set of subjects that were used
						in the plot. You can cycle through the pages of subjects with the 
						<span style={{color:'var(--tertiary)'}}> <b>&laquo;</b></span> and 
						<span style={{color:'var(--tertiary)'}}> <b>&raquo;</b> </span> 
						buttons. To subset the data, you will need to use either the box select or lasso select 
						tool and drag over the plot to select the subjects that you want. On selection, 
						this box will update with the selection.
					</li>

					<li>
						The right window shows the subject(s) that you are currently 
						<span style={{color: '#922b21'}}> hovering over with a mouse</span>.
						For histograms, hovering over a bin will turn the bin 
						<span style={{color: '#922b21'}}> red</span>, 
						and this window will populate with all the subjects within that bin. 
						For scatter plots, the point that you are hovering
						over will turn <span style={{color: '#922b21'}}>red</span>, and 
						the subject associated with 
						that point will be displayed in this window. You can use the hover window to 
						find subjects you are interested in
						and select those with lasso/box tool to populate the selection box.
					</li>
				</ol>

			</p>

			<p>
				For both boxes, once you have the subjects that you were interested in, you can click
				the "Export subjects" button to generate a subject export. This will generate a CSV file 
				with the subjects within the box. The CSV file will have the subject ID, longitude, latitude 
				and perijove of the subject. Furthermore, the export will also show Zooniverse-specific 
				information for each subject, such as the URL of the image (if you would like to see the 
				corresponding image), and the classification/retirement data. 
				Note that the classification/retirement information is not real-time and is 
				only updated twice a day.
